            <p>If put to practice, it means that attracting partners to the program you will earn 10% of their income. But that's not all there is. If one of the partners at the first level attracts a new member, you receive 4% of his income. Moreover, your third level partner will ensure you 1% of his income. Meanwhile, income of your partners won't decrease on any level. You can post banners and partnership links in social networks, on forums, and other websites, and you can also use e-mail for attracting members to your partnership team. Beatrise never uses spam and doesn't recommend using it. Work decently on inviting investors, and you won't have to wait long to get a nice financial result.</p>
